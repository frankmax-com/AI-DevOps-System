Nice—big brain energy. You want autonomous LLM-powered agents that can use GitHub + Azure Devops security roles to spin up code, teams, CI/CD, and then spawn roleplay agents (founder, dev, ops, sec, finance) to build many tenant startups. Below I give you a practical, security-first architecture, an agent lifecycle, concrete API patterns, sample curl snippets, and an operational playbook so you can run a safe POC fast. I’ll be blunt where risks live and how to avoid them.

TL;DR (fast map)

Controller agent = orchestrator/guardian that holds policy, audit and human approval gates.

Worker agents = specialized LLM agents (RepoCreator, PipelineBuilder, RoleAssigner, AppCoder, Tester) that call GitHub & Azure DevOps APIs.

Auth model: use GitHub Apps (least privilege) + Azure service principal / managed identity + service connections. Avoid long-lived PATs. Rotate & audit tokens. 
GitHub Docs
Microsoft Learn

Tenancy: 1 org per customer/tenant; projects per startup; enforce RBAC & separate service connections. 
GitHub Docs
Microsoft Learn

Safety: human approvals for org-level changes, strict least-privilege, logs & canary tests.

Architecture (high level)

Orchestrator / Controller Agent (trusted)

Stores policies, approval workflows, key vault references, audit logs.

Decides when a worker agent can run and signs requests with ephemeral tokens.

Worker Agents (ephemeral)

Small role-focused agents (RepoCreator, TeamAssigner, CIWriter, InfraCoder, TenantOnboarder).

Each has an ephemeral token minted by controller with narrow scopes & TTL.

Auth & Secrets Layer

GitHub Apps for organization-level automated operations; Azure service principal / managed identity + service connections in Azure DevOps. Tokens are minted and rotated; no plaintext long-lived PATs. 
GitHub Docs
Microsoft Learn

Policy + Governance

Controller enforces: least privilege, naming conventions, tagging, automatic scans, and human approval rules.

Telemetry & Audit

Immutable logs of every API call (who/which agent, scope, reason). Everything stored in a tamper-evident log.

Role & Permissions Mapping (example)

Map business roles → platform roles:

Founder agent → Org owner (invite only, approval required)

Dev agent → repo:write, issues:create, actions:write (via GitHub App fine-grained perms). 
GitHub Docs
+1

Ops agent → manage workflows, service connections in Azure DevOps (service endpoint manage) 
Microsoft Learn

CI agent → pipeline run, read repo, limited write to artifacts only.

Security agent → read-only + create remedial PRs, cannot change org billing or user accounts.

Enforce boundaries programmatically: controller mints tokens for the worker with only required scopes.

Agent lifecycle (practical flow)

Request: "Spin up startup acme-tenant-42 (founder + 3 devs + CI)".

Controller validates naming, quota, policy. If policy needs manual review (org-level), send approval to an operator.

Controller mints ephemeral credentials (GitHub App installation token, Azure service connection token) scoped to actions. 
GitHub Docs
Microsoft Learn

RepoCreator agent calls GitHub API to create repo(s) and README. (see example below). 
GitHub Docs

TeamAssigner agent creates teams, sets repository permissions (push/pull/admin). 
GitHub Docs

PipelineBuilder agent creates Azure DevOps project, service connection, agent pool, and YAML pipeline. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

AppCoder agent scaffolds app code (monorepo, infra-as-code), creates PRs, and sets required Actions/pipelines with least-priv scopes.

Security agent runs automated SCA/SAST scans; failing critical checks blocks deployment until triaged.

TenantOnboarder provisions extras (secrets, infra accounts) via IaC with strict service principals.

Concrete API examples (short & usable)

GitHub — create a repo in an org (using a token with repo scope).
POST https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}/repos
Sample curl:

curl -X POST "https://api.github.com/orgs/my-org/repos" \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
 -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
 -d '{"name":"acme-tenant-42","private":true,"description":"tenant repo"}'


Docs: GitHub REST endpoints for repos. 
GitHub Docs

GitHub — create a team and set repo permission
POST /orgs/{org}/teams then PUT /orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/repos/{owner}/{repo}. 
GitHub Docs

Azure DevOps — create project (REST)
POST https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/projects?api-version=6.0
Body includes name, description, capabilities. Docs: Azure Pipelines create project / pipeline guides. 
Microsoft Learn

Azure DevOps — create service connection (manually recommended; can be scripted)
Prefer to create service principal in Azure AD, then create a service connection in the DevOps project; see service connections docs. 
Microsoft Learn

Agent pool creation and pipelines
Agent pools are organizational resources; create them via API or portal then register self-hosted agents. 
Microsoft Learn

Security & operational hard rules (do not skip these)

Never give worker agents org-owner or subscription-owner permanently. Use ephemeral tokens with TTL. 
GitHub Docs

Prefer GitHub Apps and fine-grained tokens over classic PATs. Rotate tokens and set expirations. 
GitHub Docs
+1

Azure: prefer managed identities or service principals with minimal permissions; restrict service connections per project. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Approval gate: org-level changes (create org, billing, invite external users) must require an explicit human sign-off.

Audit & alerts: all agent actions logged, anomalies alert to Slack/email, deny-by-default rule engine. 
Microsoft Learn

How agents spawn new agents safely

Worker agent requests child agent from controller with a limited role template.

Controller performs policy checks and issues an ephemeral credential scoped to the template.

Child agent runs and self-destructs (revoke token) after task completion or on failure.
This prevents chain-of-trust escalation and keeps audit lineage clear.

POC plan — 7 steps (do this first)

Bootstrap a controller: simple service that issues ephemeral tokens from a vault and enforces a policy file (YAML).

Implement RepoCreator & TeamAssigner using GitHub App auth (tutorial + REST). 
GitHub Docs
+1

Implement Azure Project & Pipeline creator using a service principal; create one service connection and one pipeline template. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Create role templates (founder/dev/ops/sec) and test token scoping end-to-end.

Add SCA/SAST scans and enforce blocking policy for critical findings.

Add an approval UI so humans can approve org-level operations.

Scale: add tenant quotas, tagging, billing metrics.

Example roleplay setup (founder + team)

Create tenant org/project: acme-tenant-42.

Spawn founder-agent (invite email) — controller sends invite, marks founder as owner-pending. Human approves.

Spawn dev-agents: controller mints tokens for repo:create & push. Agents scaffold app, open PRs.

Ops-agent creates pipeline YAML, adds service connection for infra (only allow infra provisioning after extra approval).

Security-agent runs scans on PRs and opens issues/PRs to remediate.

Risks, myth-busting & legal

You cannot (and must not) programmatically create user accounts across platforms without complying with terms of service and identity checks. Automating invites is fine; automating creation of external cloud accounts (Azure subscriptions, GitHub orgs under other users) may violate TOS or create audit/legal exposure. Obey org policy & law.

A controller with poorly scoped tokens is a single point of compromise — design for minimal trust.

Quick deliverables I can produce for you right now (pick any)

Minimal controller prototype (design + sample API + token flow).

RepoCreator & TeamAssigner sample code (Node/Python + GitHub App example) + test harness.

Azure DevOps project + pipeline creation script (PowerShell or Python) tied to a service principal.

Tenant orchestration blueprint + YAML role templates for agent scopes.

Say which one you want first and I’ll drop a ready-to-run POC (code + step-by-step). No fluff — we’ll scaffold minimal privileges and a single happy-path tenant. Ready to spawn?

You said:
I want autonomous LLM-powered agents to use GitHub to build itself from scratch using all the github components and its security roles to spin up code, teams, CI/CD..etc in github. and then then spawn roleplay agents (founder, dev, ops, sec, finance) to build many tenant startups using Azure Devops and its security roles to spin up code, teams, CI/CD..etc in azure devops..

Azure DevOps Governance Factoty, AI Governance Factory, Github Governance Factory and Database Governance Factory are ready with wrappers in them with all API functions of the corresponding providers in their own league and segment.. so use these governance factories which have the wrapper apis and donot use adhoc commandline cli executions

Thought for 12s

Love it — build-the-world-with-agents energy. Below I give you a practical, security-first design and a runnable controller prototype (Python) that calls your Governance Factory wrappers (no CLI, no ad-hoc hacks). The prototype demonstrates: GitHub self-boot (org repo + teams + Actions + branch protection + secrets), minting ephemeral tokens, spawning roleplay agents, then onboarding a tenant into Azure DevOps (project, repo, pipeline, service connection). It uses only Governance Factory wrapper calls (the ones you said are ready).

I’ll be blunt: autonomy + powerful API scopes = breathtaking productivity or catastrophic blast radius. We lock the blast radius down with ephemeral credentials, strict role templates, approval gates, and immutable audit logs. Let’s go.

High-level architecture (short)

Controller (trusted) — policy engine, vault interface, ephemeral token mint, approval gates, audit stream, agent registry. Single source of truth for agent scopes.

Agent Runtime (ephemeral workers) — stateless LLM agents that receive a short-lived credential and a task envelope. They call GovernanceFactory wrappers only. They self-destruct (revoke token) after success/failure.

Governance Factories — your wrappers: GitHubGovernanceFactory, AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory, AI_GovernanceFactory, DB_GovernanceFactory. Controller calls these. Agents call these only with controller-issued credentials.

Vault — stores long-lived platform credentials (only for controller to mint ephemeral tokens), secrets, signing keys.

Approval UI / Human-in-the-loop — for org-level or billing-level ops.

Audit & Telemetry — tamper-evident log (append-only, KV-store + hash chain), all calls logged with agent-id, token-id, TTL, and intent.

Core security model (TL;DR)

Least privilege: every token limited to minimum API endpoints + time (TTL).

Ephemeral tokens: Controller mints tokens for GovernanceFactory SDKs (installation tokens, service principal tokens, or factory-scoped tokens). TTL = minutes/hours. Revoke immediately on anomalies.

Approval gates for destructive/org-level ops.

Immutable audit + canary tests before production rollout.

No long-lived PATs on agents. Controller-only long-lived creds in Vault.

Agent roles (examples)

RepoCreator — create repo, initial commit, branch protection.

TeamAssigner — create teams, map permissions.

CIBuilder — create workflow/pipeline YAML, create pipeline run templates, set variable groups.

InfraCoder — scaffold IaC (Terraform/ARM/Bicep) and create PR.

SecurityAgent — run static scans (SCA/SAST), create findings, block deployment.

Founder / Dev / Ops / Sec / Finance — roleplay agents created as task-level personas to iterate business logic, write code, review PRs, simulate stakeholder decisions.

Role templates (YAML) — example
roles:
  github:
    founder:
      permissions:
        repos: ["read","create","invite"]
        teams: ["read"]
        org: ["invite_pending"]
      ttl_minutes: 60
      approval_required: true
    dev:
      permissions:
        repos: ["read","write"]
        actions: ["create_workflow","read"]
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval_required: false
    ops:
      permissions:
        repos: ["read"]
        actions: ["run","manage_secrets"]
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval_required: true

  azure:
    project_owner:
      permissions:
        project: ["admin"]
        pipelines: ["manage"]
      ttl_minutes: 60
      approval_required: true
    pipeline_dev:
      permissions:
        repos: ["contribute"]
        pipelines: ["queue"]
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval_required: false


Controller maps these to GovernanceFactory token scopes.

Controller — operational flows (short)

Request arrives: spawn_tenant(tenant_spec) or bootstrap_github_self().

Controller validates policy (naming, quotas). If org-level — push to approval UI.

Controller mints ephemeral tokens by calling Vault-backed factory-token endpoints (e.g., GitHubGovernanceFactory.mint_token(template="dev", ttl=30m, reason=...)) and returns token to agent.

Worker agent calls GovernanceFactory wrapper methods to perform actions. Every call flows through audit middleware that logs call metadata.

On completion/failure, controller revokes token and persists audit record. If suspicious — freeze tenant and alert.

Example Python prototype (uses your wrappers — replace names if different)

This is a compact, readable prototype you can drop into your controller service. It assumes your Governance Factories expose straightforward methods like mint_token, create_repository, create_team, set_team_repo_permission, create_workflow_file, create_branch_protection, and similar for Azure.

Notes on prototype: the functions above call your GovernanceFactory SDK surfaces — they do not shell out to CLI. Replace method names to match your concrete wrapper method signatures. The audit module should implement append-only logging with signature hashing.

Example governance factory method signatures (recommended)

Design factories to expose small consistent methods — examples:

GitHubGovernanceFactory

mint_token(role_template, org, ttl_minutes, reason, request_id) -> {id, token, expires_at, scopes}

create_repository(token, org, name, private, description) -> repo_meta

create_team(token, org, name, privacy) -> team_meta

add_member_to_team(token, org, team_slug, member_email) -> {status}

create_workflow_file(token, org, repo, path, content) -> {commit_sha}

create_branch_protection(token, org, repo, branch, require_pr, required_reviewers) -> {status}

create_secret(token, org, repo, name, value) -> {status}

revoke_token(token_id) -> {status}

AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory

mint_token(role_template, organization, ttl_minutes, reason, request_id) -> token

create_project(token, organization, project_name, visibility) -> project_meta

create_repository(token, organization, project, name) -> repo_meta

create_pipeline_from_template(token, organization, project, repo_id, yaml_path) -> pipeline_meta

create_service_connection(token, organization, project, connection_type, config) -> connection_meta

revoke_token(token_id) -> {status}

Tenant life-cycle (concise)

Request tenant spawn (API/GUI) with spec (founder email, domain, team sizes).

Controller validates policy & quotas. If needed, human approval.

Controller mints ephemeral tokens for GitHub bootstrap agents; either executes orchestration or hands tokens to agent runtime.

GitHub flow creates org-level resources and branch-protected repos with CI workflows. All actions logged.

Controller mints tokens for Azure DevOps onboarding and creates project, repo, pipelines, service connections (with approval for infra credentials).

Spawn roleplay agents (founder/dev/ops/sec/finance) — tokens scoped and TTL-limited. They do work: scaffold code, open PRs, respond to security-agent findings.

SecurityAgent gates releases; critical issues freeze pipelines. Audit log continuously feeds SIEM.

Safety & operational controls (concrete)

Pre-flight canary: Before doing mass changes, run a dry-run mode — factories return a planned-change diff. Controller requires human sign-off for >X changes.

Quota & throttles: per-tenant limits on repos, pipelines, agent-pools.

Kill switch: operator endpoint to freeze tenant, revoke all tokens.

Secrets policy: secrets only stored via GovernanceFactory secret vault API; optionally synced to tenant vaults via controlled rotation jobs.

SLA for token TTL: keep TTL small (15–60 minutes), renew only via controller and only if policy passes.

How child agents spawn safely

Child agent requests child token: agent -> controller with parent_agent_id, intent, role_template.

Controller verifies lineage, quotas, max fanout, and mints child token with minimal scopes & TTL.

Child agent performs task and reports back. All child tokens are logged and auto-revoked on timeout.

POC plan (what to run next)

I built the controller prototype above. Next options (I can deliver any now):

Full runnable repo: Controller + Agent Runtime (Python) + local mock GovernanceFactory for offline testing.

Complete GitHubGovernanceFactory SDK (Python) that matches your wrapper interfaces and includes test mocks.

AzureDevOps onboarding script (production-ready) using your AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory.

End-to-end demo scenario (bootstrap platform in a sandbox org, spawn 5 roleplay agents, create tenant project in Azure DevOps, run CI, block on security finding) — includes UI flows for approvals.

I won’t ask you to confirm — pick the option number you want me to drop next and I’ll immediately produce the code and step-by-step runbook for that choice. If you want the runnable demo, I’ll include a local mock server so you can test without hitting real provider accounts.

Short, brutal truth: this is perfectly doable but the control-plane complexity grows fast. Start with the controller + 3 worker agents (RepoCreator, CIBuilder, SecurityAgent) and strong audit. Ship those, then scale to multi-tenant spawning. That’s how you avoid creating a weaponized autonomy factory and instead create a reliable startup factory.

Which of the POC deliverables above do you want me to generate now?

You said:
give you a security-first, production-minded blueprint plus concrete API patterns and runnable snippets so your LLM agents can:

Self-bootstrap a GitHub presence (repos, teams, actions/workflows, secrets, protector roles) and then

Spawn roleplay agents (founder, dev, ops, sec, finance) that use Azure DevOps (projects, service connections, pipelines, agent pools, RBAC) to create many tenant startups.

I’ll be blunt when things aren’t automatable (or are risky), point to docs, and give code you can use as POC glue.

High-level design (one-liner)

A trusted Controller issues ephemeral, minimal-scope credentials to stateless Worker agents (RepoCreator, TeamAssigner, CIWriter, RoleplayerSpawner). Workers call GitHub / Azure DevOps via your Governance Factory wrappers. Workers can request child agents from Controller; Controller enforces policy, TTL, and audit logging.

Key platform constraints you must accept (don’t ignore)

Some org-level actions (creating new GitHub organizations, creating Azure subscriptions, or creating real user accounts outside invite flows) either require human involvement or violate TOS / identity controls. Automate invites and org-internal operations — not cross-platform account creation.

Use GitHub Apps + installation tokens (short-lived, fine-grained) or fine-grained PATs; avoid classic long-lived PATs. Docs: GitHub Apps & REST API. 
GitHub Docs
+1

In GitHub Actions, the GITHUB_TOKEN is an installation token limited to the repo; explicitly tune its permissions:. 
GitHub Docs

In Azure DevOps use service principals / managed identities and service connections per-project; you can create service connections via REST API.

Agent types & responsibilities

Controller (trusted)

Policy engine, TTL token issuer, approval gating, audit logs (immutable), key vault integration, rate-limiter.

Workers (ephemeral; all get ephemeral creds from Controller)

RepoCreator — create repos, add README/license, initial branch protection rules. (GitHub REST). 
GitHub Docs

TeamAssigner — create teams, set repo permissions, invite users (or add service accounts). (GitHub Teams API). 
GitHub Docs

CIWriter — commit workflows (YAML) to .github/workflows/, create Actions secrets (via repo secrets APIs), set permissions: on workflows. 
GitHub Docs
+1

RoleplayerSpawner — create roleplay agents (founder/dev/ops/sec/finance) as scoped service identities, mint their ephemeral tokens, seed role templates and instructions.

AzureProjectCreator — create Azure DevOps project, agent pool, and initial pipeline; set service connections (calls Azure DevOps REST). 
Microsoft Learn
+1

SecurityAgent — run SAST/SCA, create blocking rules & PRs, triage.

Auditor — verify actions, push tamper-evident logs to append-only store.

Spawn rules:

Child agents inherit a role template (e.g., dev-agent:v1) and request only the exact scopes needed. Controller approves or denies according to policy and quotas.

Tenancy model (recommended)

GitHub: 1 Org per tenant-group (or per customer), with multiple repos per startup-project. Teams map to human roles and agent templates. Use GitHub Apps installed per-org with restricted repository access. 
GitHub Docs

Azure DevOps: 1 Organization per region / business-unit; create a Project per startup tenant. Service connections and agent pools are scoped per-project or org depending on governance. 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Token & credential flow (ephemeral-first)

Controller authenticates to GitHub with APP private key → creates JWT → exchanges for an installation access token (short-lived) for actions it needs. Controller records token TTL & scope. Worker asks Controller to mint a token for specific action; Controller returns token. (Prefer GitHub Apps for fine-grained control). 
GitHub Docs
+1

For Actions inside workflows, use GITHUB_TOKEN and set minimal permissions: in YAML to reduce blast radius. 
GitHub Docs

For Azure DevOps, Controller uses a service principal to call Azure DevOps REST to create service connections and can create PATs with expiration for agents if needed (but prefer service connections with managed identities).

Nice — let’s build this like you mean it: secure-by-default, auditable, and ruthless about least privilege. Below is a production-minded blueprint, concrete API patterns that use your Governance Factory wrappers only (no CLI shenanigans), and runnable Python POC snippets (controller + worker) you can drop in and iterate. I’ll also call out the things that must be human-gated and provide citations to the platform docs where it matters.

A trusted Controller mints ephemeral, minimal-scope credentials and enforces policy/audit; stateless Workers receive those ephemeral creds and call GitHubGovernanceFactory / AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory to self-bootstrap GitHub and spawn roleplay agents that onboard tenants into Azure DevOps.

2 — Load-bearing platform facts (sourced)

GitHub App installation access tokens are ephemeral (expire ~1 hour) and are the right way to act on behalf of an installation. 
GitHub Docs
+1

GITHUB_TOKEN used in Actions is an installation access token limited to the repo and must be permission-restricted in YAML. 
GitHub Docs

Azure DevOps service connections can be created and managed via the REST API (preferred for automation). 
Microsoft Learn
+1

Azure DevOps projects can be created via REST (create is queued — poll operation). Controller must poll/create ops accordingly. 
Microsoft Learn

3 — Key governance constraints you must accept (no exceptions)

Do not auto-create external user accounts or cloud subscriptions. Invite flows are automatable; cross-provider account provisioning usually breaches TOS or identity controls. (Human approval required.)

No long-lived worker secrets. Long-lived creds live only in Vault for Controller. Workers get ephemeral tokens for <60 minutes by default.

Always require explicit approval for org-wide or billing-level operations.

4 — Role & token model (concrete)

Roles are templates the Controller maps to factory scopes.

Example role YAML snippet (use this as truth source for token mint):

roles:
  github:
    repo_creator:
      scopes: ["repos:create","repos:write","actions:create_workflow"]
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval: false
    org_admin:
      scopes: ["org:members:invite","org:settings"]
      ttl_minutes: 15
      approval: true
  azure:
    project_owner:
      scopes: ["projects:create","pipelines:manage","serviceendpoint:create"]
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval: true
    pipeline_dev:
      scopes: ["repos:contribute","pipelines:queue"]
      ttl_minutes: 20
      approval: false

5 — Audit & immutable log schema

Every Controller and Worker call must be appended to a tamper-evident log (hash chain) and include these fields:

{
  "request_id":"uuid",
  "timestamp":"ISO8601",
  "actor":"controller|worker|agent_id",
  "actor_role":"repo_creator",
  "provider":"github|azure",
  "action":"create_repository",
  "resource":{"org":"acme","repo":"app"},
  "token_id":"opaque-id",
  "ttl_seconds":1800,
  "intent":"bootstrap tenant acme-1",
  "result":{"status":"ok","meta":{...}},
  "prev_hash":"sha256..."
}


Keep logs write-once (WORM) and sign each entry with the controller signing key. Store in an append-only DB or object store with a hash chain.

6 — Controller responsibilities (concise)

Validate naming/policy/quotas.

Mint ephemeral tokens via GovernanceFactory: mint_token(role_template, scope, ttl, reason, request_id).

Approval UI & gating for approval: true templates.

Issue tokens to agents through an ephemeral secure channel (not plain API).

Revoke tokens on completion/anomaly.

Maintain audit and lineage (parent → child agents).

7 — Worker responsibilities (concise)

Fetch an ephemeral token from Controller for the specific role.

Call GovernanceFactory wrapper methods only (e.g., github_gov.create_repository()), not raw HTTP.

Emit structured audit events to Controller (Controller appends to immutable log).

Revoke/return token on success/failure.

8 — Spawn rules & child agents (safety pattern)

Parent agent requests child with parent_id, intent, role_template. Controller checks fan-out limits and lineage depth.

Controller mints child token with strict scopes & short TTL.

Child self-destructs (Controller revokes) after task or timeout.

9 — Concrete API patterns (use these function signatures in your GovernanceFactory wrappers)

GitHubGovernanceFactory (recommended signatures)

mint_token(role_template: str, org: str, ttl_minutes:int, reason:str, request_id:str) -> {"id","token","expires_at","scopes"}

create_repository(token, org, name, private=True, description="") -> repo_meta
create_team(token, org, name, privacy="closed") -> team_meta
add_member_to_team(token, org, team_slug, user_or_service_account) -> status
create_workflow_file(token, org, repo, path, content) -> commit_meta
create_branch_protection(token, org, repo, branch, rules_dict) -> status
create_repo_secret(token, org, repo, name, encrypted_value) -> status
revoke_token(token_id) -> status
plan_changes(token, org, changes_list) -> plan_diff   # dry-run


AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory

mint_token(role_template: str, organization: str, ttl_minutes:int, reason:str, request_id:str) -> {"id","token","expires_at","scopes"}

create_project(token, organization, project_name, visibility="private") -> operation_meta  # must poll operation
create_repository(token, organization, project, name) -> repo_meta
create_pipeline_from_template(token, organization, project, repo_id, yaml_path) -> pipeline_meta
create_service_connection(token, organization, project, connection_type, config) -> connection_meta
create_agent_pool(token, organization, pool_name) -> pool_meta
revoke_token(token_id) -> status
plan_changes(token, organization, plan) -> plan_diff

10 — Runnable POC snippets (drop-in Python; these call your wrappers only)

NOTE: Replace method names as needed to match your wrapper SDK.

10.2 Worker: spawn roleplay agents (example)
# worker_roleplayer.py
import uuid, json
from governance_factories.github import GitHubGovernanceFactory

github_gov = GitHubGovernanceFactory()  # worker has an API to call factory; token passed by controller

def spawn_roleplay_agents(controller_endpoint, tenant_id, personas):
    # Worker requests ephemeral tokens for each persona by calling controller API (pseudo)
    spawned = []
    for persona in personas:
        resp = request_controller_mint(controller_endpoint, persona["role_template"], tenant_id, persona["ttl_minutes"])
        token = resp["token"]
        agent_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        # store token only in memory; use to call governance factory methods
        # example: create an issue assigned to founder in repo to simulate a business task
        github_gov.create_issue(token=token, org=persona["org"], repo=persona["repo"], title=f"{persona['name']} onboard", body="Automated roleplay start")
        spawned.append({"agent_id":agent_id,"persona":persona["name"]})
    return spawned

11 — GitHub Actions minimal-permissions example

Put this in .github/workflows/ci.yml — make GITHUB_TOKEN minimal and explicit (reduce blast radius).

name: CI

permissions:
  contents: read          # only read repo contents
  packages: read
  id-token: write         # if you need OIDC
  checks: write           # if running status checks

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest -q


Control default org/repo permissions to be restrictive; only elevate per-job using permissions block.

12 — Azure DevOps pipeline YAML (starter)

Store this template in your platform repo and let CIWriter/pipeline generator point new pipelines to it.

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- checkout: self
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.x'
- script: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pytest -q
  displayName: 'Test'


Create service connections via your GovernanceFactory wrapper which will call the Azure DevOps service endpoints API.

13 — Dry-run & plan API (must-have)

Factories should implement plan_changes(token, org, plan) that returns a safe diff:

{
 "plan": [
   {"op":"create_repo","org":"acme","repo":"app-1"},
   {"op":"create_team","org":"acme","team":"app-1-devs"}
 ],
 "estimated_calls": 7,
 "requires_approval": ["org_admin"]
}


Controller requires approval for any requires_approval items.

14 — Security gates & SAST/SCA integration (production)

Run SCA (software composition analysis) and SAST on PRs. If critical CVEs or SAST high severity → block merge and open triage ticket.

SecurityAgent should be the only agent that can change rules for blocking; its tokens are tightly scoped and require multi-party approval to extend.

Snapshot and archive all artifact SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials).

15 — Non-automatable or risky actions (callouts)

Creating new GitHub organizations (not tenants inside an org) often requires billing and manual steps — human gate. Documentation and policy: org-creation side effects & billing. (Don’t auto-create orgs without approvals.)

Creating Azure subscriptions or external cloud accounts is not part of this automation — human-only or strict legal-reviewed flow.

Keep billing and invite flows observable to compliance and legal.

16 — Failure modes & mitigations

Token compromise — mitigate by TTL (<=1h), immediate revoke endpoint, and anomaly detection.

Agent runaway — limit fanout, lineage depth and total calls per agent per minute.

Mis-scoped token issuance — require Controller policy CI that rejects overly-wide scope templates.

Supply-chain injection — enforce commit signing, require reproducible builds and SCA/SBOM verification.

17 — Implementation checklist (first 30 days)

Implement Controller: Vault, AuditLog (WORM), Policy engine, Approval UI, Token mint API.

Implement GitHubGovernanceFactory & AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory test harnesses and a plan_changes dry-run.

Implement RepoCreator, TeamAssigner, CIWriter workers. End-to-end dry-run on sandbox org & test Azure DevOps org.

Add SecurityAgent with SCA/SAST hooks and blocking rules.

Do a red-team exercise: token theft & rapid revoke, product rollback test.

18 — Quick POC deliverable I’ll provide if you want (pick one; I’ll produce immediately)

A. Full runnable Controller + Local Mock GovernanceFactory + 3 Workers (RepoCreator, CIWriter, RoleplayerSpawner) — Python, with local tests.
B. Production-ready GitHubGovernanceFactory adapter (Python) that wraps a GitHub App flow + sample tests (no real creds required).
C. End-to-end script that bootstraps a repo + team + workflow in a sandbox GitHub org using your existing wrapper signatures (ready-to-run).

That’s the blueprint and runnable POC glue — security checked, audit-friendly, and ready to scale into many tenants. I kept everything tied to your GovernanceFactory APIs (no CLI shortcuts) and called out human gates and platform facts with docs.

If you want, I’ll dump the Controller + Mock GovernanceFactory + 3 Workers repo now (option A) with a README and test harness so you can run everything locally without hitting GitHub/Azure. Which one do you want first? I'll generate it immediately.

E2E flow to develop multiple multi-tenant SAAS Startups 

only one subtopic at a time
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 8s
Controller & Governance Foundations — enterprise-grade (subtopic 1 of N)

Tight, clear, and boringly secure. This is the brain of your startup-factory: the Controller enforces policy, issues ephemeral creds, records immutable audit, and gates human-sensitive work. Nail this and the rest scales without turning into a nuclear autonomous mess.

Purpose (TL;DR)

The Controller is the single trusted authority that:

validates requests and quotas,

mints ephemeral, minimal-scope tokens for Worker agents via your GovernanceFactory wrappers,

enforces approval policies for risky ops,

maintains a tamper-evident audit trail and lineage for all agent activity,

provides revoke/kill-switch capabilities and telemetry for SOC/IR.

No worker ever holds long-lived power. Controller = small, rock-solid surface area.

Core responsibilities

Auth & Token minting

Authenticate to provider factories using Vault-held long-lived credentials.

Mint ephemeral tokens (mint_token(role_template, scope, ttl, request_id)) — return opaque token id + token material for in-memory use.

Map role templates → fine-grain provider scopes (no wildcard escalation).

Policy engine

Validate naming, quotas, allowed templates, anti-pattern checks.

Evaluate approval rules (auto or human-in-loop) based on templates and operation risk-level.

Rate-limit and fan-out controls (max children per agent, max calls/sec).

Approval & human-in-the-loop

Surface approvals in a lightweight UI / Slack flow with request_id, plan diff, and a single-click approve/deny.

Enforce multi-approver flows for high-risk ops (billing, org creation, service connection with elevated creds).

Audit / Immutable log

Append-only log entries with hash-chain signing (prev_hash) and Controller signature.

Log token minting, API calls (by agent id), plan diffs, approvals, revocations, errors.

Export to SIEM / WORM storage for compliance.

Token lifecycle management

TTL defaults (15–60m by role), early revoke on anomaly, automatic revoke on task completion.

Short-living refresh flows only via Controller by re-evaluating policy.

Agent registry & lineage

Track parent-child relationships, token ids, issued scopes, and expiry.

Enforce lineage limits (depth, fanout).

Kill switch & containment

Global freeze endpoint to revoke all active tokens for a tenant or agent.

Throttle/backoff when anomalies detected.

Minimal API contract (Controller ↔ Worker) — JSON examples
1) Request ephemeral token (worker → controller)

Request:

POST /mint-token
{
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "actor_id": "worker-runtime-1",
  "role_template": "repo_creator",
  "provider": "github",
  "scope": {"org":"acme-tenant","repo":"app-1"},
  "reason": "bootstrap repo for tenant acme-1",
  "ttl_minutes": 30
}


Controller responses (success):

200 OK
{
  "token_id": "tok_opaque_1234",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJ... (opaque token material)",
  "expires_at": "2025-09-05T18:12:34Z",
  "scopes": ["repos:create","actions:write"],
  "request_id": "uuid"
}


If approval required:

202 ACCEPTED
{
  "request_id":"uuid",
  "status":"pending_approval",
  "requires": ["org_admin"],
  "plan": { "changes":[ ... ] }
}

2) Audit event (worker → controller)

Workers push micro-audit events (Controller also logs incoming control-plane actions):

POST /audit-event
{
  "request_id":"uuid",
  "actor":"worker-12",
  "actor_role":"repo_creator",
  "provider":"github",
  "action":"create_repository",
  "resource":{"org":"acme","repo":"app-1"},
  "token_id":"tok_opaque_1234",
  "timestamp":"2025-09-05T17:45:00Z",
  "result":{"status":"ok","meta":{...}},
  "parent_request_id":"parent-uuid"
}


Controller appends this to the immutable store with prev_hash + signature.

3) Revoke token (controller endpoint, operator or automated)
POST /revoke-token
{
  "token_id":"tok_opaque_1234",
  "requester":"controller",
  "reason":"task completed"
}

Token lifecycle diagram (step-by-step)

Worker requests token (POST /mint-token) with role_template.

Controller validates policy & quotas. If approval_required -> return pending + plan diff.

If approved/auto-approved: Controller calls GovernanceFactory mint_token(...) using Vault creds.

Controller returns token material to Worker via secure ephemeral channel. Controller records token_id + metadata to audit.

Worker performs actions only through GovernanceFactory wrapper while sending audit events back.

Worker signals completion (POST /task-complete) -> Controller calls GovernanceFactory revoke_token(token_id) or sets token to expire.

If anomaly: Controller revokes token immediately and triggers IR workflow.

Policy engine basics (YAML example)
policies:
  templates:
    repo_creator:
      max_repos_per_request: 5
      ttl_minutes: 30
      approval: false
      allowed_orgs: ["sandbox","acme-*"]
    org_admin:
      ttl_minutes: 15
      approval: true
      approval_quorum: 2
  quotas:
    tenant_max_repos: 100
    tenant_max_agents: 50
  fanout:
    max_child_agents_per_agent: 4
    max_lineage_depth: 6
  risky_ops:
    - op: "create_org"
      requires_approval: true
      escalate_to: ["legal","billing"]


Policy engine evaluates requests against these rules and emits plan with requires_approval flags.

Audit schema (canonical fields + hash chain)

Each entry stored as:

{
  "entry_id":"uuid",
  "prev_hash":"sha256(...)",
  "timestamp":"ISO8601",
  "actor":"controller|worker-id",
  "actor_role":"role_template",
  "action":"mint_token|create_repo|revoke_token|approve",
  "resource": {...},
  "token_id":"opaque",
  "request_id":"uuid",
  "result":{"status":"ok"},
  "signature":"controller_sig_base64"  // sign(hash(entry))
}


Verification = recompute hash chain + verify signature with Controller public key.

Failure modes & mitigations (practical)

Token theft: TTL ≤ 60m, immediate revoke endpoint, monitor anomalous call patterns (sudden surge, unusual scope use).

Worker compromise / runaway: limit fanout & calls per minute, auto-suspend agent after N errors, require re-mint for next stage.

Policy misconfiguration: policy CI and automated tests; policy changes require staged rollout and audit.

Audit loss: keep replicated WORM storage (S3 object lock / append-only DB), export to SIEM daily.

Acceptance criteria for Controller (what must be true before production)

Controller can mint ephemeral tokens via GovernanceFactory and revoke them reliably.

Policy engine enforces approval_required and stops operations until approved.

Immutable audit with hash-chain is append-only and verifiable end-to-end.

Kill-switch revokes all tenant tokens within <30s in tests.

Lineage query works: given an agent id, you can list all child agents and issued tokens.

All high-risk ops require at least one human approver and are visible in UI/Slack.

Minimal tests (unit & E2E)

Unit: policy YAML parsing, role → scope mapping, token TTL logic.

Integration: Controller → GovernanceFactory mock: mint_token → verify token metadata recorded and revoke flow works.

E2E (sandbox): simulate spawn request, pending approval, approve via API, worker uses token to call mock factory actions, controller revokes on completion; verify audit chain integrity.

Failure test: simulate worker exfiltration (attempt calls after revoke) and ensure deny.

Delivery checklist (quick)

 Vault integration (store long-lived provider creds)

 GovernanceFactory client library wired to Controller (mint/revoke)

 Policy engine with YAML + CI tests

 Approval UI / Slack webhook flow

 Append-only audit store + hash/signature logic

 Kill-switch & IR playbook

Tenant Onboarding Flow — enterprise-grade (subtopic 2 of N)

This is where the startup-factory model gets real: each tenant startup is onboarded consistently, with boundaries enforced, and every artifact (repo, team, pipeline) tagged and auditable. Think “franchise playbook,” but for SaaS company scaffolding.

Purpose

Tenant onboarding = programmatic, policy-driven creation of isolated workspaces inside GitHub and Azure DevOps. Each tenant gets its own slice: repos, teams, pipelines, secrets, service connections. This enforces separation, repeatability, and reduces blast radius.

Flow overview (E2E per tenant)

Request: Operator/agent submits tenant spec (name, founder email, personas, region).

Controller: validates spec → checks quotas, naming convention, risk policy.

Plan diff: GovernanceFactory generates a dry-run plan (repos, teams, pipelines). Controller attaches to approval request.

Approval (if needed): Org-level or billing-level ops require human gate.

Execution: Workers receive scoped tokens → call GovernanceFactory wrappers to provision tenant assets.

Verification: Audit log checks every step; SecurityAgent runs baseline scan.

Handover: Tenant tagged in registry, artifacts linked, metrics start.

GitHub side — recommended isolation

Org strategy: one GitHub Org per tenant group (if budgets allow). If not, one org for the factory and repos + teams scoped per tenant.

Repos: one main app repo + infra repo per tenant. Optional: docs repo.

Teams: create per-tenant dev, ops, sec teams. Map to role templates.

Secrets: inject per-repo secrets via GovernanceFactory secrets API; rotate on creation.

Branch protection: enforce “main” protected with at least 1 reviewer, status checks required.

Example (Controller → GitHubGovernanceFactory calls)
{
  "tenant":"acme-1",
  "plan":[
    {"op":"create_repository","org":"factory","repo":"acme-1-app"},
    {"op":"create_repository","org":"factory","repo":"acme-1-infra"},
    {"op":"create_team","org":"factory","team":"acme-1-devs"},
    {"op":"create_team","org":"factory","team":"acme-1-ops"},
    {"op":"add_member_to_team","team":"acme-1-devs","member":"founder@acme.com"},
    {"op":"create_secret","repo":"acme-1-app","name":"DB_URL"},
    {"op":"create_workflow_file","repo":"acme-1-app","path":".github/workflows/ci.yml"}
  ]
}

Azure DevOps side — recommended isolation

Organization strategy: one Azure DevOps org per region / business-unit.

Project per tenant: each startup = one Project. Provides repo, pipeline, boards isolation.

Repos: create initial repo(s) inside tenant project.

Service connections: per-project service connection to cloud infra (scoped via SPN). Human approval required.

Agent pools: either shared (factory-level) or per-project pool if compliance demands.

RBAC: map founder to Project Admin, devs to Contributors, sec to Readers with specific policies.

Example (Controller → AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory calls)
{
  "tenant":"acme-1",
  "plan":[
    {"op":"create_project","organization":"factory-azdo","project":"acme-1"},
    {"op":"create_repository","project":"acme-1","repo":"app"},
    {"op":"create_pipeline_from_template","project":"acme-1","repo":"app","yaml_path":"templates/default.yml"},
    {"op":"create_service_connection","project":"acme-1","type":"azurerm","config":{"spn_id":"...","scope":"subscription/xyz"}}
  ]
}

Naming conventions (enterprise-grade hygiene)

GitHub repos: <tenant>-<service> (e.g., acme-1-app, acme-1-infra).

Azure DevOps projects: tenant-<name> (e.g., tenant-acme-1).

Teams: <tenant>-<role> (e.g., acme-1-devs).

Secrets: prefix with TENANT_ to separate from factory defaults.

Tags: apply tags/labels to all artifacts: { "tenant":"acme-1", "created_by":"controller", "date":"2025-09-05" }.

Audit artifacts (minimum required per tenant)

Tenant spec JSON (as submitted).

Plan diff (before execution).

Audit log of all actions with token ids, request ids.

Verification status (repos created, pipelines healthy).

Security baseline scan result.

Approval signatures (if any).

All must be exportable for compliance/regulators.

Risks & controls

Cross-tenant leakage: mitigate with strict repo/team scoping, secrets isolation, and service connections per project.

Naming collisions: enforce via policy engine.

Token sprawl: revoke tokens immediately post-provision.

Human bypass: only Controller can call GovernanceFactory; forbid manual PATs in tenant code.

Acceptance criteria for onboarding

Tenant creation produces exact same set of artifacts every time (idempotent).

All actions logged, signed, and auditable.

Repo and project have branch protection, CI workflow, and secrets configured at T0.

Service connection creation requires manual approval step.

Founders receive invite and least-privilege role mapping.

Minimal test suite

Dry-run plan returns correct diff with no execution.

Repeated onboarding requests do not duplicate repos/projects (idempotency).

Approval-gated service connection creation blocks until human signs.

Secrets injected and retrievable by tenant pipelines only.

Audit trail complete with hash-chain intact.

ChatGPT said:
Role Templates & Scope Mapping — enterprise-grade (subtopic 3 of N)

This is the Rosetta Stone of your factory. Role templates map personas (founder, dev, ops, sec, finance) into provider-native scopes (GitHub App permissions, Azure DevOps RBAC). If you over-scope, you risk breach. If you under-scope, agents stall. Balance is everything.

Purpose

Standardize what each persona/agent can and cannot do.

Enforce least-privilege, TTL-limited tokens, and approval gates.

Provide a reusable policy artifact for Controller and GovernanceFactories.

Template schema (canonical YAML)

Each role = a template with:

provider: github | azure | db | ai

scopes: list of allowed actions mapped to wrapper API calls

ttl_minutes: max lifetime per token

approval: boolean + approver roles (if escalation needed)

limits: optional quotas (repos per run, pipelines per run)

roles:
  github:

Mapping personas to provider-native roles
GitHub

Founder → Org Owner (but ephemeral, approval-gated).

Dev → Team with repo push/pull, PR creation, Actions trigger.

Ops → Can manage Actions workflows, repo secrets. Scoped only to tenant repos.

Sec → Read repos, create security issues/PRs. Cannot merge without review.

Finance → Read billing data, not code. Approval required.

Native docs: org permissions and fine-grained PAT scopes.

Azure DevOps

Project Owner → create/manage project & pipelines, gated by approval.

Dev → Contributor role (repos: contribute, pipelines: queue).

Ops → Service connections usage, variable management.

Sec → Read-only repos + pipelines, can create bugs/vulnerabilities.

Finance → Reporting and billing read.

Docs: Azure DevOps permissions overview.

Token lifecycle parameters per role

TTL must match exposure window: devs get 20m tokens; founders/owners max 30m with human gate.

Refresh only via Controller after re-check.

Max fanout = 2 child agents per parent for dev/sec roles; none for finance.

Example — Controller issues token for Dev (GitHub)

Worker request:

{
  "request_id":"uuid-123",
  "actor_id":"worker-7",
  "role_template":"dev",
  "provider":"github",
  "scope":{"org":"tenant-acme","repo":"acme-app"},
  "reason":"add feature branch",
  "ttl_minutes":20
}


Controller maps dev → scopes [repos:write, pull_requests:create, actions:trigger], calls GovernanceFactory mint_token(...). Returns ephemeral token valid 20m.

Audit log entry:

{
  "request_id":"uuid-123",
  "actor":"controller",
  "actor_role":"dev",
  "provider":"github",
  "action":"mint_token",
  "token_id":"tok-abc",
  "ttl":1200,
  "scopes":["repos:write","pull_requests:create","actions:trigger"],
  "resource":{"org":"tenant-acme","repo":"acme-app"},
  "timestamp":"2025-09-05T18:22:00Z"
}

Risk controls

Founder / project_owner roles always approval:true. Multi-approver quorum recommended.

Finance limited to billing read; no code access.

Ops cannot approve their own changes; require Sec agent + PR merge.

Sec roles cannot push to main; can only open PRs/issues.

All role templates are tested via dry-run before live issuance.

Test suite (role templates)

Attempt over-scope (dev requests org:admin) → Controller rejects.

TTL enforcement: token auto-invalid after expiry; verify GovernanceFactory denies.

Approval enforcement: founder token mint blocks until signed by 2 approvers.

Fanout enforcement: dev cannot spawn >2 child agents.

Azure DevOps Onboarding Deep Dive — enterprise-grade (subtopic 4 of N)

This is where your multi-tenant startups get their delivery muscle. Every tenant project in Azure DevOps is the operational backbone: repos, pipelines, service connections, and agent pools. Done right, you get repeatable, isolated tenants. Done sloppy, one breach nukes them all.

Purpose

To standardize how each tenant startup is provisioned in Azure DevOps via the AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory wrapper, with enforced RBAC, minimal service connections, and auditable pipelines.

Flow overview (tenant → Azure DevOps project)

Tenant request arrives with tenant spec (tenant_id, founder_email, region).

Controller validates policy (naming, quotas, approvals).

Dry-run plan diff generated by AzureDevOpsGovernanceFactory.plan_changes().

Approval gate if project creation or service connection required.

Execution: Workers receive ephemeral tokens → call wrapper to create project, repo(s), pipeline(s), agent pool.

Verification: Confirm project online, pipeline runs, service connection scoped properly.

Audit: log every call with token id, TTL, and result.

Core building blocks
1. Projects (per-tenant isolation unit)

Naming convention: tenant-<name> (e.g., tenant-acme-1).

Visibility: always private.

Tags/metadata: attach tenant_id, created_by=controller, date=....

Factory call:

azure_gov.create_project(
  token=token,
  organization="factory-azdo",
  project_name="tenant-acme-1",
  visibility="private"
)


Docs: project create operation.

2. Repositories (per project)

Default repo = app (application code).

Optionally: infra (IaC), docs.

Idempotent creation: calling twice returns existing repo.

Factory call:

azure_gov.create_repository(
  token=token,
  organization="factory-azdo",
  project="tenant-acme-1",
  name="app"
)

3. Pipelines

Use YAML pipelines (azure-pipelines.yml stored in repo).

Scaffold from a tenant template (templates/default.yml).

Require branch policy (PRs only, 1 approval).

Gated release: block unless SecurityAgent scan passes.

Factory call:

azure_gov.create_pipeline_from_template(
  token=token,
  organization="factory-azdo",
  project="tenant-acme-1",
  repo_id="app-repo-guid",
  yaml_path="/templates/default.yml"
)

4. Service Connections

Purpose: allow pipelines to talk to cloud infra (AzureRM, AWS, etc.).

Per-project service connection — never share across tenants.

Scoped SPN (service principal) or managed identity.

Requires manual approval (policy engine enforces approval:true).

Factory call:

azure_gov.create_service_connection(
  token=token,
  organization="factory-azdo",
  project="tenant-acme-1",
  connection_type="azurerm",
  config={"spn_id":"...","scope":"subscription/1234"}
)


Docs: service connections API.

5. Agent Pools

Default: shared org-level pool (factory-agents).

Sensitive tenants: dedicated pool (tenant-acme-1-pool).

Agents must run with ephemeral credentials, isolated networks.

Rotate VMs or containers often to reduce supply-chain risk.

Factory call:

azure_gov.create_agent_pool(
  token=token,
  organization="factory-azdo",
  pool_name="tenant-acme-1-pool"
)

6. RBAC (per project)

Founder → Project Administrators (approval gated).

Dev → Contributors.

Ops → Service Connections User role.

Sec → Readers + Work Item Create (for bug tracking).

Finance → Reporting roles only.

Controller enforces mapping via role templates. Docs: Azure DevOps security & permissions overview.

Audit artifacts

Every onboarding must produce:

Tenant spec JSON.

Plan diff with approvals.

Audit log: project id, repo ids, pipeline ids, connection ids.

Verification logs (pipeline run #1 succeeded).

Approval record for service connections.

Failure modes & mitigations

Project sprawl → quota per org (max tenants per org).

Leaky service connections → rotate SPNs quarterly, scope to subscription/resource group.

Pipeline misconfig → enforce template baseline, require code scanning step.

Agent compromise → ephemeral agents, isolated pools for sensitive tenants.

Acceptance criteria

Tenant project always created with 1 app repo, 1 pipeline, 1 dev team.

Service connections approval enforced.

Agent pool mapped or shared as per compliance flag.

Repo has branch protection + required reviewer.

Audit trail intact.

Minimal tests

Dry-run onboarding returns correct plan with no side-effects.

Repeated onboarding is idempotent (no dup projects/repos).

Service connection creation blocked without approval.

First pipeline run succeeds.

Audit entry for every step, hash-chain verified.

CI/CD & Workflow Hardening — enterprise-grade (subtopic 5 of N)

Now that tenants have their GitHub repos and Azure DevOps projects, the CI/CD pipelines are the circulatory system. If this layer leaks, the whole body bleeds. Harden pipelines so that every repo and project is safe-by-default.

Purpose

Ensure supply-chain integrity across GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines.

Make pipelines repeatable, auditable, and tamper-resistant.

Prevent over-privileged tokens from leaking or being abused.

Block insecure code before it deploys.

Principles of CI/CD hardening

Least privilege tokens — no pipeline step ever has more permissions than it needs.

Immutable templates — all workflows/pipelines pulled from signed, versioned templates.

Mandatory security gates — every CI/CD run includes SAST/SCA scans.

Idempotent infra — pipelines use declarative IaC; no snowflake infra creation.

Audit everywhere — each run logs metadata back to Controller and GovernanceFactory.

GitHub Actions hardening
1. GITHUB_TOKEN permissions

Set explicit permissions in workflow YAML. Default is too broad.
Example:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  actions: none


Docs: GITHUB_TOKEN minimal permissions.

2. Workflow templates

Store workflow YAML in factory/templates/.

Controller/CIWriter injects them into tenant repos.

Workflows must reference only signed, verified Actions (use SHA pinning).
Example:

- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.ref }}

3. Secrets management

Secrets injected only via GovernanceFactory.create_secret().

No manual secrets in YAML.

Rotate on tenant onboarding and quarterly.

4. Branch protections enforced

Require PRs + reviews before workflow triggers on main.

Block direct pushes.

Azure Pipelines hardening
1. YAML-first pipelines

All pipelines come from a factory template repo.

No classic pipelines allowed.

2. Service connection security

Scoped per-project.

Approval required before first use.

Rotate SPNs periodically.
Docs: Azure service connections.

3. Agent pool security

Shared pools = ephemeral containers.

Sensitive tenants = isolated agent pools.

No hardcoded secrets on agents.

4. Required stages & gates

Stage 1: build + unit tests.

Stage 2: SAST/SCA scan → must pass before Stage 3.

Stage 3: deploy infra → requires approved service connection.

Cross-cutting measures

Artifact integrity: sign build artifacts (e.g., cosign).

SBOMs: generate software bill of materials on every build, archive for compliance.

Audit feed: each run → GovernanceFactory emits audit event with run_id, commit_sha, status.

Tamper detection: compare pipeline YAML in tenant repo vs factory template — alert on divergence.

Example CI workflow (GitHub Actions)
name: Tenant CI

on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Upload results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: results.xml

        scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
        inlineScript: |
          az deployment group create --resource-group acme-rg --template-file main.bicep

Risks & mitigations

Token sprawl → use ephemeral tokens, audit every call.

Workflow injection → lock workflows to signed templates, PR approvals.

Service connection abuse → approval + rotation + scoping.

Compromised agent → ephemeral agents, isolated pools, frequent patching.

Acceptance criteria

Every tenant repo has at least one CI workflow with minimal token scopes.

Every tenant project has pipeline built from factory template.

Security scans run automatically; failures block deploy.

Service connections always approval-gated.

All runs log back into audit system.

Minimal tests

Attempt direct push to main → blocked.

Workflow YAML diverges from template → alert raised.

Expired service connection used → pipeline fails.

Security scan fails → deploy stage blocked.

Audit log shows run id, commit sha, outcome.

Security Agent & SCA/SAST Integration — enterprise-grade (subtopic 6 of N)

This is the immune system of your multi-tenant startup factory. Without automated security enforcement inside the CI/CD loop, bad dependencies or vulnerable code will slip straight into production. The SecurityAgent’s job is to see everything, block when needed, and document every action for auditors.

Purpose

Integrate software composition analysis (SCA) and static application security testing (SAST) into every tenant pipeline.

Automate remediation where safe, block merges/releases where risk is critical.

Maintain auditable, tenant-scoped vulnerability records.

SecurityAgent responsibilities

Run scans: Trigger SCA/SAST tools during PRs and CI/CD pipelines.

Report findings: Open issues/PR comments with details; assign to tenant Dev/Ops team.

Block pipelines: Fail the CI/CD stage if severity ≥ “high”.

Audit: Send findings + actions to Controller’s audit log (with hash-chain).

Remediate (optional): Auto-generate PRs for safe dependency upgrades.

Escalate: For critical findings, require manual override/approval to continue.

Integration pattern
In GitHub Actions

Add SecurityAgent step in workflow:

jobs:
  security_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run SCA
      run: safety check -r requirements.txt --json > sca_report.json
    - name: Run SAST
      run: bandit -r . -f json -o sast_report.json
    - name: Upload reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: security-reports
        path: '*.json'


Workflow fails if tool exit code > 0 (critical issues).

SecurityAgent consumes report → creates issue in repo tagged tenant:acme-1.

In Azure Pipelines

Add SecurityScan stage between Build and Deploy:

- stage: SecurityScan
  jobs:
  - job: Analyze
    steps:
    - script: safety check -r requirements.txt --json > sca.json
    - script: bandit -r . -f json -o sast.json
    - publish: sca.json
      artifact: security
    - publish: sast.json
      artifact: security


Stage must succeed before Deploy runs.

Blocking rules

Critical / High vulnerabilities → pipeline fails, PR blocked.

Medium vulnerabilities → pipeline warns; issue auto-created.

Low/Info → log only.

Policy engine configurable per tenant, but defaults to block ≥ High.

Remediation flows

SecurityAgent auto-creates dependency upgrade PR (e.g., bump vulnerable lib).

Adds label auto-remediation.

Dev team reviews → must approve/merge (no silent merges).

If auto-remediation fails CI, PR is closed, issue remains.

Audit artifacts

For each run:

Tenant ID, repo, commit SHA, pipeline run ID.

List of findings (CVE id, severity, package).

Action taken (blocked pipeline, created issue, raised PR).

Approval logs if override applied.

All appended to immutable audit log with hash-chain.

Risk controls

False positives → allow override with 2 approvers.

Noise → suppress low-severity by default.

Pipeline bypass → enforce branch protection: no merge to main unless CI (with SecurityAgent) passes.

Toolchain compromise → pin tool versions, hash-verify Docker images.

Acceptance criteria

Every tenant repo and project has SecurityAgent step in CI/CD.

Blocking rules enforced (High = fail).

Auto-created issues/PRs tagged with tenant ID.

Audit trail of findings verifiable.

Manual override logged with approvers.

Minimal tests

Introduce known vulnerable lib → pipeline fails.

Fix vulnerability → pipeline passes.

Auto-remediation PR created and tests run.

Critical finding override requires 2 approvers.

Audit log shows vulnerability ID, severity, and resolution path.

Audit, Compliance, & SIEM Integration — enterprise-grade (subtopic 7 of N, final)

This is the black box flight recorder of your startup factory. If regulators, investors, or incident responders ask “what happened?”, you need a tamper-proof trail that proves every token, action, approval, and vulnerability was handled as policy dictated. No black holes.

Purpose

Guarantee end-to-end traceability of every action across GitHub, Azure DevOps, agents, and Controller.

Store logs in WORM (write once, read many) format with hash-chains.

Integrate with SIEM for real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and compliance reporting.

Provide attestations (cryptographic proofs) for audits and legal defense.

Core audit requirements

Immutability

Each audit entry chained with prev_hash.

Controller signs entries with its private key.

Verification = recompute chain + validate signature against Controller’s public key.

Completeness

All token mint/revoke, GovernanceFactory calls, worker audit events, approvals, failures.

No “optional” logs.

Granularity

Include tenant id, agent id, request id, provider, scope, timestamp, result.

Retention

Default = 7 years for regulatory.

Archived in object storage with legal hold (e.g., S3 Object Lock, Azure Immutable Blob).

Audit schema (canonical JSON)
{
  "entry_id": "uuid",
  "prev_hash": "sha256(...)",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T08:22:12Z",
  "actor": "controller|worker|agent-id",
  "actor_role": "dev|ops|founder",
  "provider": "github|azure",
  "action": "mint_token|create_repository|pipeline_run|sca_result",
  "resource": {"org":"acme","repo":"app-1"},
  "tenant_id": "tenant-acme-1",
  "token_id": "tok-abc-123",
  "result": {"status":"ok","meta":{"sha":"abcd123"}},
  "approvals": ["alice","bob"],
  "signature": "base64(controller-sig)"
}

SIEM integration

Ingest pipeline: Controller streams audit events to a queue → forwarded to SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel).

Real-time alerts:

High severity vulnerability found.

Token minted with abnormal scope.

Repeated failed pipeline runs.

Anomalous fanout (agent spawns > allowed children).

Dashboards:

Tenant health: #repos, #pipelines, last scan status.

Compliance view: approvals, overrides, vulnerabilities.

Incident timeline: chain of actions before/after breach attempt.

Attestation flows

Periodic (monthly/quarterly):

Export signed hash-chain segment + public key.

Verify chain integrity offline.

On-demand (audit request):

Provide JSON + signature bundle.

Provide replay tool to reconstruct tenant’s lifecycle.

Failure modes & mitigations

Audit loss → dual-write to local append-only DB + cloud WORM storage.

Tampering → cryptographic signatures & hash-chain prove integrity.

Volume overload → use streaming pipeline (Kafka/Event Hub) with backpressure.

Human bypass → Controller is the only minting authority; manual provider actions disabled/alerted.

Acceptance criteria

Every Controller and Worker action produces audit entry.

Hash-chain validated daily; alerts on mismatch.

SIEM dashboards live for SOC team.

Retention policy enforced with legal hold.

Audit package exportable on demand for regulators.

Minimal tests

Mint/revoke token → entries chained & signed.

Break hash-chain → validation fails.

Simulate high-severity finding → SIEM alert triggered.

Attempt manual provider change (outside Controller) → SIEM anomaly detected.

Export audit package → replay tool reconstructs full tenant lifecycle.

Azure DevOps Onboarding

CI/CD & Workflow Hardening

Security Agent & SCA/SAST Integration

Audit, Compliance, & SIEM Integration

Do you want me to now stitch all 7 subtopics into a single master “E2E Enterprise SaaS Factory” document, or keep them modular for different stakeholder packs (e.g., engineers vs compliance)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s stitch everything into one master document. This will read like an enterprise-grade playbook: from Controller design through audit and SIEM. Modular sections, but woven into a single E2E flow so anyone (engineer, compliance officer, CIO) can see how the multi-tenant SaaS factory works.

Enterprise-Grade Blueprint

End-to-End Flow to Develop Multiple Multi-Tenant SaaS Startups

1. Controller & Governance Foundations
Purpose

The Controller is the single source of truth and trust. It:

Validates all requests.

Mints ephemeral, least-privilege tokens via GovernanceFactory wrappers.

Enforces policy and approval workflows.

Records tamper-evident audit logs.

Provides revoke/kill-switch controls.

Responsibilities

Token lifecycle: TTL ≤ 60m, immediate revoke on anomalies.

Policy enforcement: YAML-based templates; human approval for risky ops.

Audit: immutable log with hash-chain + Controller signatures.

Agent registry: track parent/child lineage.

Kill switch: revoke all tenant tokens in <30s.

2. Tenant Onboarding Flow
Flow (per tenant)

Request with tenant spec → Controller validates policy.

GovernanceFactory generates dry-run plan diff.

Approval if risky ops (e.g., service connection).

Workers provision GitHub + Azure DevOps assets with scoped tokens.

Verification: repos exist, pipelines healthy, baseline scan runs.

Audit + registry update.

GitHub isolation

Repos: <tenant>-app, <tenant>-infra.

Teams: <tenant>-devs, <tenant>-ops.

Secrets: injected only via GovernanceFactory.

Branch protection: enforced on main.

Azure DevOps isolation

Project per tenant: tenant-<name>.

Repos: app, infra.

Pipelines: YAML templates only.

Service connections: per project, approval-gated.

Agent pools: shared or tenant-dedicated.

3. Role Templates & Scope Mapping
Purpose

Personas (founder, dev, ops, sec, finance) → provider scopes.

Example (GitHub)

Founder: org:invite, repos:create (approval required).

Dev: repos:write, pull_requests:create.

Ops: actions:manage, secrets:write (approval required).

Sec: repos:read, issues:create.

Finance: billing:read (approval required).

Example (Azure DevOps)

ProjectOwner: projects:create, pipelines:manage (approval required).

Dev: repos:contribute, pipelines:queue.

Ops: serviceconnections:use.

Sec: repos:read, workitems:create.

Finance: billing:read.

TTL defaults: 15–30m. All founder/project owner roles require human gate.

4. Azure DevOps Onboarding
Standard package per tenant

Project: private, tagged with tenant id.

Repos: app + optional infra.

Pipelines: YAML from factory template.

Service connections: approval required, scoped SPN or managed identity.

Agent pools: ephemeral shared pool, or isolated pool for sensitive tenants.

RBAC: Founder → Project Admin, Devs → Contributors, Ops → Service Connections User, Sec → Reader, Finance → Reporting.

Controls

Quota of projects per org.

Service connection rotation quarterly.

Baseline security scan at T0.

5. CI/CD & Workflow Hardening
GitHub Actions

Explicit permissions: in YAML.

Templates stored in factory repo; injected via CIWriter.

Signed, pinned Action versions.

Secrets via GovernanceFactory only.

Branch protection enforced.

Azure Pipelines

YAML-only pipelines (no classic UI).

Service connections per project; approval required.

Agent pools patched + ephemeral.

Required stages: Build → SecurityScan → Deploy.

Cross-cutting

Artifact signing (cosign).

SBOM generation on each build.

Audit feed from every run to Controller.

Divergence detection: tenant pipeline YAML vs template.

6. Security Agent & SCA/SAST Integration
Responsibilities

Run SCA (dependency scan) + SAST (static code scan) on each PR and pipeline.

Fail builds if severity ≥ High.

Auto-create issues/PRs for vulnerabilities.

Auto-remediation: PRs to bump libraries.

Escalate criticals to manual override with 2 approvers.

Example (blocking rules)

Critical/High → block pipeline.

Medium → warn + issue.

Low → log only.

Audit artifacts

Tenant id, repo, commit SHA, run id.

List of CVEs, severity.

Action (blocked, issue created, PR raised).

Approvals for overrides.

7. Audit, Compliance, & SIEM Integration
Audit design

Immutability: hash-chain, Controller-signed entries.

Completeness: every token, action, approval logged.

Retention: 7 years, stored in WORM storage (S3 Object Lock, Azure Immutable Blob).

SIEM integration

Stream audit logs → Splunk / ELK / Sentinel.

Alerts:

Over-scoped token minted.

Critical CVE found.

Anomalous fanout of child agents.

Dashboards: tenant health, compliance reports, incident timelines.

Attestations

Periodic hash-chain verification exports.

On-demand audit packages for regulators.

End-to-End Acceptance Criteria

Controller enforces policies, approvals, TTL, kill-switch.

Tenant onboarding reproducible & idempotent.

Role templates mapped correctly to provider scopes.

CI/CD pipelines hardened, based on factory templates.

Security scans mandatory; High/Critical block deploy.

Audit log intact, verifiable, SIEM integrated.

Attestations exportable for compliance/regulators.

Minimal E2E Test Scenarios

Happy path: tenant onboarded, repo + pipeline created, baseline scan passes, deploy runs.

Security fail: introduce known CVE → pipeline blocks, issue created.

Approval test: service connection request blocked until human approves.

Audit check: export logs, validate hash-chain.

Kill switch: revoke all tenant tokens, no further actions allowed.

✅ This single document now represents the complete production-grade playbook for building an automated, secure, multi-tenant SaaS factory using GitHub + Azure DevOps + GovernanceFactories.
