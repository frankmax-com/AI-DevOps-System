# 🔗 **Template Mapping: GitHub Projects → Azure Boards**

## 🏢 **Governance Level (GitHub Projects)**

These are **backlog/project templates** used for **Epics, Features, Tasks** that Agents manage.
They flow downstream into Azure Boards for execution.

| GitHub Project Template   | Purpose (Governance)               | Azure Boards Equivalent                       | Purpose (Execution)                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Roadmap**               | Long-term planning, portfolio view | **Portfolio Backlog (Epics)**                 | Strategic Epics spanning programs/products     |
| **Team planning**         | Organize Epics/Features for team   | **Team Backlog (Features)**                   | Features grouped under Epics, visible to teams |
| **Feature release**       | Track feature delivery cycles      | **Iteration/Sprint Backlog**                  | Features/tasks in active sprint/iteration      |
| **Kanban**                | Visual task tracking, WIP limits   | **Kanban Board**                              | Task board for in-progress work                |
| **Bug tracker**           | Centralized bug intake             | **Bug Work Items**                            | QA + defect management in Azure Boards         |
| **Iterative development** | Backlog refinement + sprint flow   | **Scrum Board (Stories/Tasks)**               | Agile execution in iterations                  |
| **Product launch**        | Multi-team launch planning         | **Release Backlog**                           | Work items tied to release pipelines           |
| **Team retrospective**    | Governance of lessons learned      | **Azure DevOps Wiki / Work Item Discussions** | Documentation + retrospective actions          |

---

## 🎯 **Flow in Action (Example)**

1. **Idea logged in GitHub (Roadmap project)**

   * PM Agent converts idea → Epic → Feature.
   * Epic is tracked in GitHub **Roadmap project**.

2. **Sync to Azure DevOps (Portfolio Backlog)**

   * Epic created in Azure Boards → **Portfolio Backlog**.
   * Features created in Azure → **Team Backlogs**.

3. **Work Iterations**

   * GitHub “Feature release” project → Azure **Iteration Backlog**.
   * Tasks → GitHub Kanban → Azure Kanban board.

4. **Defects & QA**

   * Bugs logged in GitHub “Bug Tracker”.
   * Synced to Azure Boards as bug work items, executed in Azure Test Plans.

5. **Release & Launch**

   * GitHub “Product Launch” project → Azure **Release Backlog**.
   * Linked to **Azure Pipelines** for deployment.

6. **Retrospective**

   * Retrospective board in GitHub → actions sync to Azure Wiki + Tasks.

---

## 🧩 **Why This Matters**

* **GitHub = Governance Factory** 🏭
  → Think *plans, Epics, compliance, audit*.
* **Azure = Execution Portfolio** 📦
  → Think *code, pipelines, tests, releases*.

Agents keep them in sync:

* PM Agent → Roadmap/Epics
* Dev Agent → Kanban/Tasks
* QA Agent → Bug Tracker/Test Cases
* Release Agent → Product Launch/Release Backlog

---

⚡ So every GitHub template you picked **has a 1:1 downstream equivalent** in Azure Boards, meaning:

* You can **govern in GitHub** (visible, auditable).
* You can **execute in Azure** (enterprise-grade delivery).
