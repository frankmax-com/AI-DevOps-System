## 🎯 **Purpose and Scope**

The AI Provider Agent Service serves as the **central intelligence router** for the entire AI DevOps ecosystem, providing:

- **Intelligent AI Provider Routing**: Task-based model selection across multiple providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Free tier prioritization with enterprise failover
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Monitoring, quotas, failover, and authentication
- **Unified API**: Single integration point for all agent services

## 📋 **Documentation Standards**

All specification documents follow these standards:

### **Structure**
- Executive Summary
- Detailed Requirements/Design
- Implementation Notes
- Acceptance Criteria
- Dependencies and Assumptions

### **Formatting**
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include diagrams where applicable
- Provide code examples for technical specs
- Use consistent terminology

### **Traceability**
- Link requirements to design decisions
- Reference implementation tasks
- Connect user stories to features

## 🔄 **Document Lifecycle**

1. **Draft**: Initial specification creation
2. **Review**: Technical and business review
3. **Approved**: Signed off for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Feature developed and deployed
5. **Maintained**: Ongoing updates and refinements

## 🏷️ **Priority Levels**

- **P0**: Critical - Core functionality, system won't work without it
- **P1**: High - Important features for MVP
- **P2**: Medium - Enhances user experience
- **P3**: Low - Nice to have, future considerations

## 📊 **Metrics and KPIs**

Key metrics tracked across specifications:

- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, availability
- **Cost**: Provider usage costs, infrastructure costs
