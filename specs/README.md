# Orchestrator Service - Specifications

## üìã Overview

The Orchestrator Service is the **central nervous system** of the AI DevOps platform - a sophisticated request routing and coordination engine that transforms Azure DevOps webhook events into intelligent, automated software development workflows. This service bridges the gap between human project management and AI-driven development automation, orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade governance and CMMI compliance.

## üéØ Vision Statement

Deliver an **enterprise-grade orchestration platform** that:
- **Centralizes all workflow coordination** across the AI DevOps ecosystem
- **Intelligently routes requests** to appropriate specialized agent services
- **Maintains complete audit trails** for enterprise compliance and governance
- **Provides human-in-the-loop escalation** for complex scenarios requiring intervention
- **Ensures CMMI compliance** through comprehensive work item lifecycle management
